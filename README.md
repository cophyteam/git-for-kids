Basic information to get started with Git for kids and their parents.

Open a command line.

Type `git clone https://github.com/cophyteam/git-for-kids`

If it does not work, install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

Then, check the documents of this repository, especially Sotiris' [Git_101.md](Git_101.md).

No more excuse! 😋
